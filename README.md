# Fraud and Anomaly Detection

## Overview
The goal of the project is to compare various machine learning models and find the model with the highest accuracy score in predicting and detecting faudulent activities and anomaly patterns. 

## Tools and Programming Language(s)
Python, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter

## Data source
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Process
1. Import all necessary libraries.
2. Conduct EDA to explore the data and its features.
3. Explore various classifiers and machine learning models that can product the highest accuracy score.

Simple ML notebook:
- Conducts simple EDA to learn more about the dataset
- Produces confusion matrices for all models

Binary Classfication notebook:
- Builds a feedforward neural network to train the model
- Compares 3 different machine learning models: Isolation Forest, K-means, One-Class SVM

Advanced ML notebook:
- Utilizes SMOTE to overcome the problem of overfitting the training dataset
- Deploys grid search to all classifiers to obtain the best parameters
- Compares 4 classifiers: SGD, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN
